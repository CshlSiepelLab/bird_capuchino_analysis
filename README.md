These directories contain scripts for reproducing the analysis in the paper "Genomic islands of differentiation in a rapid avian radiation have been driven by recent selective sweeps" by Hussein A. Hejase, Ayelet Salman-Minkov, Leonardo Campagna, Melissa J. Hubisz, Irby J. Lovette, Ilan Gronau, and Adam Siepel (2020).

The scripts are not published as a finished software but for informational purposes and transparency of our analysis. Most of the analysis was done on a cluster, with segments of the genome analyzed separately.

Some details, such as where data was downloaded or how filtering was done, are described in the methods section of the main text.

<h4>The scripts assume the installation of the following software:</h4>
1.	ARGweaver [1]: http://github.com/CshlSiepelLab/argweaver.git <br />
2.	SLiM version 2.3 [2]

<h4>Directories:</h4>
1. Simulations/ Contains all script for simulations. <br />
2. Scripts/ Contains some miscellaneous scripts.
